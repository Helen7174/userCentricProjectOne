## First Milestone Project
## Personal Web Developer Website

### Summary
The purpose of this project is to use all the knowledge gained create a static website with one to four pages.
This project is based on ***HTML*** to structure each page, ***CSS*** and ***BootStrap 4*** to style each element on the four pages. 

In most cases CSS was implemented to style the HTML, but in some other cases to access to BootStrap components and change the default aspect.

### Landing page
A brief introduction with some stylings.
Here is the home page of my project, which on the top will display a navigation bar for big screen sizes, and on mobile size will display the home link [jos.e.enciso](https://skrkrw.github.io/userCentricProjectOne/) which stands from my first and last names, Jos√© Enciso, with a little bit of creativity.

### Skills and Portfolio pages
Using the bootstrap cards structure, and customized with HTML and CSS to change the order of the elements, size, etc.


### Contact Me
In the "Contact Me" page you will find a simple form, in which all the components are manipulated to change the way they look.

### The tool
Different tools were used throughout the development of this project.

* For version control, ***Git*** and ***GitHub*** were used. This allowed changes to be made and to save them, if some of them were not the right change or did not fit with the new styling, or sometimes move through the history's branch.
In the end, GitHubDesktop was introduced to make the task of working with ***Git*** easier through the command line, by doing it with a visual application. 

* ***AWS*** and ***GitPod***, these are excellent **IDE** based ***online***, however for some circumstances they are not suitable options.

* ***VS Code***, this software does not require internet conection to work, for this reason, and because sometimes there was no way to access to the internet or the speed was not fast enough, ***VS Code*** was used in most cases.
